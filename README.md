~~A proxy to allow vanilla 1.12.2 clients to connect to a Forge server with cubic chunks.~~

...and it's already redundant. I showed a screenshot of my progress so far to Barteks2x, who promptly said "this can be done directly as part of Cubic Chunks" and then proceeded to actually implement it directly as part of Cubic Chunks. Needless to say, it's a lot better than what I'm able to pull off with a proxy, as it can allow both CC and vanilla clients to connect to the same server, and even have modded clients with all mods but Cubic Chunks connect. Naturally, it also yields far superior performance to this as well, and there's one less proxy required for a big server network.

In short this project was amazing and unique for all of 5 hours, and is now rendered redundant by like 4 hours of work on Barteks' part. For CC support with vanilla clients, see [the updated Cubic Chunks repo](https://github.com/OpenCubicChunks/CubicChunks/commit/a787bed707e6ec065cee07082d7bc8645748a411).
